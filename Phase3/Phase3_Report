# Phase 3: Defensive Strategy Proposal

---

## Introduction

In this phase, a defensive mechanism was proposed, implemented, and tested to protect the vulnerable SSH service running on the victim machine (Metasploitable3).  
The goal was to mitigate brute-force SSH attacks and demonstrate the improved security status after defense deployment.

## Step 1: Environment Overview

| Machine | Role | Description |
|:--------|:-----|:------------|
| Kali Linux (VMware) | Attacker | Launched SSH brute-force attacks |
| Metasploitable3 (UTM) | Victim | Hosted SSH service |

## Step 2: Defense Selection

The chosen defensive strategy was to install and configure **fail2ban** on the victim machine.  
Fail2ban monitors system logs and automatically bans IP addresses after multiple failed SSH login attempts.

Reasons for selecting fail2ban:
- Easy and lightweight to configure.
- Effective against brute-force SSH attacks.
- Well-documented and widely used in production environments.

## Step 3: Defense Implementation

### 3.1 Install fail2ban

1- SSH into the victim machine:

```bash
ssh vagrant@172.20.10.5
```
