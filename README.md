## üìñ Project Introduction

This project was conducted as part of the ICS-344 course requirements to practice real-world cybersecurity concepts and attack-defense strategies in a controlled environment.  
The goal was to simulate an SSH brute-force attack against a vulnerable virtual machine (Metasploitable3) from an attacker machine (Kali Linux), then defend against it using security mechanisms such as Fail2Ban, and finally visualize the attack patterns using a SIEM tool (Splunk).

Throughout this project, we followed a structured approach:
- **Phase 1:** Conduct and document successful attacks.
- **Phase 2:** Collect and visualize system logs to analyze attack behaviors.
- **Phase 3:** Implement defense mechanisms and demonstrate improved security.

The entire project was performed in isolated virtual environments to ensure ethical practices.
